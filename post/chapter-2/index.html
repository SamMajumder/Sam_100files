    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Poorter et al. (2012) defines biomass allocation as the relative amount of biomass present in various plant organs and their importance as ecophysiological traits are mentioned by Mason et al. (2017), Edwards et al. (2014) and Freschet et al. (2015). This allocation pattern tends to change with regard to the environment and species and this variance of allocation should be quantitatively understood for the purposes of understanding plant ecology and evolution and their implementation in agricultural practises (Poorter et al. 2012). According to Niklas (1994) and Reich (2002) understanding how biomass allocation varies amongst species would shed light on the limitations pertaining to biomass production and utilisation. Resource availability is also another key factor which is hypothesized to influence biomass allocation as it is thought that regulation of allocation amongst organs varies until the resources obtained by each organ limit growth in an equal manner (Mason et al. 2017; Chapin, 1980 ; Bloom et al. 1985). Another factor which influences biomass allocation is life history (Mason et al. 2017). For example, between the annual and the perennial clade of Helanthus the biomass allocation is different with regard to reproduction and storage functions (Bazzaz et al. 2012).</p>
<p>Ratios between the biomass of two organs are a common way to study allocation in plants and provides the advantage of evaluating two variables with different units as well as drawing a reasonably clear conclusion with regard to the underlying biology (Poorter and Sack 2012; Liermann et al., 2004). For example, the stem to root ratio is pertinent to understanding the trade-off between above and belowground mass investments (Poorter and Sack 2012). However, ratios have been criticized for being unbounded, asymmetrical, relatively high variability and not being normally distributed (Poorter and Sack 2012; Sokal and Rohlf, 1995; Holmes and Buhr 2007 ; Jasienski and Bazzaz, 1999). Furthermore, comparing ratios at lower numbers is difficult and it is hard to draw meaningful and reliable biological conclusions with regard to allocation (Poorter and Sack 2012).</p>
<p>The use of mass fractions to study allocation is an alternative approach to ratios and provides certain advantages over ratios (Poorter and Sack 2012). For example, using mass fractions allows us to scale the values between 0 and 1 and enables us to understand the data with improved clarity and reliability (Poorter and Sack 2012). However, the possibility of spurious correlation should be taken into account when drawing inference from the data (Weller et al, 1987). The reason for this is that when two unrelated values are divided by a common unrelated denominator then they are known to exhibit high correlation with each other (Pearson 1897). The common denominator in case of allocation studies is the total biomass of the plant. In addition, it can also be said that because of how mass fractions are calculated, the numerator and denominator are not fully independent i.e “mass of the organ of interest influences both numerator and denominator of the fraction” (Mueller et al., 2000). It should be mentioned that mass fractions are known to be not normally distributed (Poorter and Sack., 2012).</p>
<p>In this study we investigate how several leaf functional traits potentially influence whole plant total biomass, leaf mass fraction, stem mass fraction, reproductive mass fraction. We do this by employing several nonparametric regression methods and tree-based classifiers suitable for non-linear and non-normal data in conjunction with multiple linear regression which usually has the same assumptions as ordinary least squares regression (OLS) to a multidimensional dataset. Using such methods not only enabled us to model nonlinear relationships but also enabled us to elucidate the importance of specific traits driving the biological associations in this study.</p>
